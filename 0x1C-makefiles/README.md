# Makefiles

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn what are makefiles, when, why and how to use them (with variables, explicit and implicit rules).

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Version of `make`: GNU Make 3.81
