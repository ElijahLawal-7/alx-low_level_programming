# Bit manipulation
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-binary_to_uint.c` | Converts a binary number to an `unsigned int` |
| `1-print_binary.c` | Prints the binary representation of a number |
| `2-get_bit.c` | Returns the value of a bit at a given index |
| `3-set_bit.c` | Sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given index |
| `4-clear_bit.c` | Sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given index |
| `5-flip_bits.c` | Returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another |
| `100-get_endianess.c` | Checks the endianness |
| `101-password` | Script that contains the password of `crackme3` file |
